The intention of this notebook is to introduce you to the concepts needed for building a multimodal search engine. Starting off with a little theory, and ending off with an implementation of a practical system that can search between spoken and handwritten digits. Sections marked as "Optional" or "Advanced" are aimed at readers who want to learn a bit more or challenge themselves, but are by no means required for the tutorial.
