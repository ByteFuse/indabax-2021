The intuition is that if we can find the hidden representations that generate the input data, these hidden representations will then describe the information needed to compare different datapoints. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture is one of the most commonly used to model this . The structure of the VAE is very similar to that of the Autoencoder, which is an encoder that takes an input and maps it to a lower dimensional vector, from which a decoder must be able to reconstruct the original input. However, with a VAE, the encoder does not simply compress the data, but also models the distribution of $P(Z|X)$, and the decoder then models the distribution of $P(X|Z)$.

In our case, we want $p(z|x)$, which we can rewrite as the function below thanks to Bayes. There are, however, a few issues with this.

Taking this into account,  we can see that when $y=1$, only the left side of the loss contributes, and when $y=0$, only the right side contributes.\n",

    "So we have methods that can take a single modality and generate a representation that allows me to find similar inputs by using a distance function between representations. But how do I search for images by using text? Or search sounds with spoken queries? It might be simpler than you think.\n",

    "There are a variety of other ways to accomplish this, but the most effective method, and one that we use at ByteFuse a lot, is to project representations from each modality into a shared space where all modalities can exist side by side.

The first and simplest method for creating these projection layers is to simply use a margin loss, as described above. Rather than just using pairs from the same modality, we sample pairs from different modalities and train our projection layers to bring them closer together. See the following example:\n",

    "OpenAI recently introduced [Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), or the more popular name, [Clip](https://openai.com/blog/clip/). The overall training procedure is depicted in the diagram below. Here, they took a text encoder and an image encoder and fed them data containing text paired with an image. Then, for each combination of text and image pairs, the dot product is calculated to form a similarity matrix. They then arrange the similarity matrix, as shown below, where the diagonal of the matrix represents the true combination's dot products. The Softmax function is then applied row by row and column by column, converting each row and vector into a probability vector. Because we know the correct combination is on the diagonal, we can apply cross-entropy to each row and column and make the label 1 for the diagonal and 0 for the rest of the positions. The model is then trained to correctly predict the correct combination.\n",

    "We can train projection layers for all modalities (given the right data) and create a massive database of all the data we (or you) have available and their corresponding representations using the techniques described above. If we get a new  input, all we have to do is feed it through the appropriate representation model and projection layer, and depending on which modality we want to return, we just do a distance search over the database of embeddings and return the closest $N$ representations. A high-level overview of how this would work in practice is provided below.\n",

    "The other option, which we will use, is to generate a spectrogram of the waveform. The overall process of generating a spectrogram is beyond the scope of this notebook, but it can be thought of as transforming raw audio data into a structure with fewer dimensions, almost like an audio fingerprint. We do this by sliding a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) window over the signal that then creates frames that describe the frequency characteristics of the signal within that window (more and MUCH BETTER information [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNqIee7cH3q1bh4QJFAaeNv0)). For the time being, think of this process as converting audio into an image representation of it. We've already converted all of your audio files into spectrograms for you (if you have run all the code above)."

Because both of our datasets are labeled, we can create a Pytorch iterable dataset that samples from both the MNIST and FSDD datasets at the same time and returns a spectrogram (our speech) with its corresponding label and a sampled MNIST digit with its corresponding label.\n",
